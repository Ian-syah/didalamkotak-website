# B-low Box Website

This website is just my side project to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

If you want to see the website, click [this](https://didalamkotak.netlify.app/).

I also make the shell script to push the project. But firstly, you have to configure your SSH. If you still use HTTP, you can't use the shell script.

> ./gitPush.sh yourCommit

If Your commit more than one word

> ./gitPush First\ Commit\ Again
